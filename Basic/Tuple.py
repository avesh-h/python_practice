# Tuples ara exactly like list (arrays) but we cannot update or delete the elements from the tuplse it's immutable

# Tuple example
# x = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')
# y = enumerate(x)

# There is method in python calles Unpacking which is similar to the destructuring in Javascript

# destructuring in Python

# cordinates = (1,2,3)

# x,y,z = cordinates

# print(x)

# It also works in List in python

# arr_one=[2,44,"less","yes"]

# x,y,z,r = arr_one

# print(r)
